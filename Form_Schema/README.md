# HOLC_Area_Description_Data
Form Schema

The HOLC used four seperate forms when assesing a particular city. These forms outline the schema used in the holc_ad_data.csv spreadsheet. Each entry corresponds to the city via the polygon_id. The cat_id, sub_cat_id and order correspond to the form and it's adjoining description.
